# BakeACake

## Project overview
- Android Baking App that allows Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. 
- This app allows a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## What i learned:
- using **MediaPlayer/Exoplayer** to display videos.
- Handling error cases in Android.
- Adding a **widget** to my app experience
- Leveraging a third-party library in my app.
- Using Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
