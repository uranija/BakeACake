## Project overview
- Android Baking App that allows Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world.

## What i learned:
- using **MediaPlayer/Exoplayer** to display videos.
- Handling error cases in Android.
- Adding a **widget to your app experience**
- Leveraging a third-party library in my app.
- Using Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
